This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in TypeScript related to type coercion.  While TypeScript's type system catches many errors at compile time, it doesn't always prevent runtime errors caused by implicit type coercion.  The `bug.ts` file shows a function that adds two numbers, but it can be called with a string, resulting in a runtime error because of Javascript's loose typing. The `bugSolution.ts` provides a solution using type guards or stricter type checking to prevent this.
